"""Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.

#if statement
a = 400
b = 40

if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

#elif statement
if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

elif a < b:
    print("A is smaller")

#if-elif-else statement
if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

elif a < b:
    print("A is smaller")
else:
    print("Both are equal")
