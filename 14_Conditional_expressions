"""Python Conditions and If statements

Python supports the usual logical conditions from mathematics:

Equals: a == b
Not Equals: a != b
Less than: a < b
Less than or equal to: a <= b
Greater than: a > b
Greater than or equal to: a >= b
These conditions can be used in several ways, most commonly in "if statements" and loops.
"""

#if statement
a = 400
b = 40

if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

#elif statement
"""ELIF CLAUSE
elif in python means [else if]. An if statements can be chained together with a lot of
these elif statements followed by an else statement.
There can be any number of elif statements.
"""
if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

elif a < b:
    print("A is smaller")

#if-elif-else statement
"""Last else is executed only if all the conditions inside elifs fail."""
if a > b :
    print("A is greater")

elif a < b:
    print("A is smaller")
else:
    print("Both are equal")


"""LOGICAL OPERATORS
In python logical operators operate on conditional statements. For Example:
• and – true if both operands are true else false.
• or – true if at least one operand is true or else false.
• not – inverts true to false & false to true.

two = 65

#AND OPERATOR
if one > three and three < two :
    print("True")

#OR OPERATOR 
if three > one or two > one :
    print("TRUE")
"""print only if At least one of the conditions is True"""

#NOT OPERATOR
