'''Use comparison operator to find out whether ‘a’ given variable a is greater than
‘b’ or not. Take a = 34 and b = 80'''

a = int(input("Enter value of a :"))
b = int(input("Enter value of b :"))
c = a>b
print("A is greater than b:",c)


#Output:
#Enter value of a :67
#Enter value of b :6
#A is greater than b: True
