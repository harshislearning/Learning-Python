### LOOPS in python


"""
Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance:  Print 1 
to 1000. 
Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to 
repeat and how! 

TYPES OF LOOPS IN PYTHON 
Primarily there are two types of loops in python. 
• while loops 
• for loops 
"""

###  WHILE LOOP 
"""In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop 
is executed otherwise not! 
If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until 
the condition becomes False."""


# WHILE LOOPS  to print 1 to 5
i = 1
while(i<6):      #or while (i<=5):
    print(i)
    i = i +1     #or i +=1


## In while loop there should be a flase condition or else loop wont stop 



#  Write a program to print the content of a list using while loops.
list = ["harsh", 23, 23.34,True,"ved","aman",False,56]
i= 0
while (i<len(list)):
    print(list[i])
    i = i + 1



### FOR LOOP

"""
A for loop is used to iterate through a sequence like list, tuple, or string [iterables] 

Syntax: 
l = [1, 7, 8] 
for item in l: 
print(item) # prints 1, 7 and 8 

## RANGE FUNCTION IN PYTHON 
The range() function in python is used to generate a sequence of number. 
We can also specify the start, stop and step-size as follows: 

range(start, stop, step_size) 
# step_size is usually not used with range() 

AN EXAMPLE DEMONSTRATING RANGE () FUNCTION. 
for i in range(0,7): # range(7) can also be used. 
print(i) # prints 0 to 6




"""



"""
FOR LOOP WITH ELSE 
An optional else can be used with a for loop if the code is to be executed when the 
loops exhausts. 

Example: 

l= [1,7,8] 
for item in l: 
print(item) 
else: 
print("done") # this is printed when the loop exhausts! 

Output: 
1 
7 
8 
done
"""

"""
THE BREAK STATEMENT 
‘break’ is used to come out of the loop when encountered. It instructs the program to – 
exit the loop now. 
27 
Example: 
for i in range (0,80): 
print(i)     
# this will print 0,1,2 and 3 
if i==3 
break 
"""


"""
THE CONTINUE STATEMENT 
‘continue’ is used to stop the current iteration of the loop and continue with the next 
one. It instructs the Program to “skip this iteration”. 
Example: 
for i in range(4): 
print("printing") 
if i == 2:   # if i is 2, the iteration is skipped  
continue 
print(i)
"""


"""
PASS STATEMENT 
pass is a null statement in python. 
It instructs to “do nothing”. 
Example: 
l = [1,7,8] 
for item in l: 
pass          
# without pass, the program will throw an error
""



# print 2 table using FOR LOOP
for i in range (2,21,2):
    print(i)


#print table from user input using FOR LOOP
num = int(input("Enter number to print table:"))

for i in range (num,1000,num):
    print(i)
    if i==(num*10):
        break
