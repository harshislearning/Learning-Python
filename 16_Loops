"""
Sometimes we want to repeat a set of statements in our program. For instance:  Print 1 
to 1000. 
Loops make it easy for a programmer to tell the computer which set of instructions to 
repeat and how! 

TYPES OF LOOPS IN PYTHON 
Primarily there are two types of loops in python. 
• while loops 
• for loops 
"""

###  WHILE LOOP 
"""In while loops, the condition is checked first. If it evaluates to true, the body of the loop 
is executed otherwise not! 
If the loop is entered, the process of [condition check & execution] is continued until 
the condition becomes False."""
